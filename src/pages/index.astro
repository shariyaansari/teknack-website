                Teknack is one of the amazing battlefields provided by ACM for
                students of not just DBIT but also of other colleges to boost up
                their creative skills and pump up their technical skills by
                integrating new ideas and concepts to build up Games that give
                the players an enduring experience that would last with them
                forever

                  <h4>Training and Guidance</h4>
                  <p>
                    We teach and train the students to develop mobile games
                    using the Unity Engine. We guide them throughout the journey
                    from ideation to release of the game.

                  <h4>Unity Development</h4>
                  <p>
                    The games are developed using the Unity Engine. Developers
                    gain hands-on experience on the platform through their
                    journey of development.

                  <p>
                    We also host an annual fest named "Teknack" and during this
                    fest, the games are published on Google Play Store and
                    various awards are declared for the developers.
                    Additionally, we organize gaming events as part of the
                    festival to foster a gaming culture

                    The games developed by the students are published on Google
                    Play Store under the banner of Teknack. This provides them
                    with a platform to showcase their talents and bring out to
                    the world, their creativity and technical skills.
